                <h3>My mental health and wellbeing?</h3>
                <p>Preparing to have a baby is an exciting time, but also a challenging one. Don’t be surprised if you
                    experience some emotional change at this time.
                    It's normal to have some worries and fears about what's coming when you're pregnant. Many people
                    feel quite stressed at this time, particularly when they know it's a big change that they can't
                    fully prepare for or control.

                    In addition, pregnancy itself can be stressful. As well as coping with hormonal and physical
                    changes, you may feel stressed about things such as antenatal tests. You may feel especially worried
                    you've had a bad experience before, such as a miscarriage.

                    For these reasons, pregnancy can increase the likelihood of developing a mental health condition</p>

                <h3>Snacks to Satisfy Your Cravings</h3>
                <p>Whether you call them snacks or mini meals, noshing on small bites throughout the day can be a
                    healthy — and easy — way to get your fill of essential nutrients, especially during pregnancy.

                    Little nibbles are easier to stomach when you’re combating stomach issues like nausea and food
                    aversions in the early weeks of pregnancy. Healthy snacks are also a good way to get nourishment
                    later on in pregnancy when you get that stuffed, can’t-eat-another-bite feeling after just a few
                    forkfuls.</p>

                <h3>Take Care Of Myself During Pregnancy!</h3>
                <p>Taking care of yourself and your baby is important. And the extensive care starts the day you realize
                    that you are pregnant. Pregnancy care is easier than expected, specifically when you start it at the
                    earliest. The concept of pregnancy care or prenatal care may include various healthy lifestyle
                    choices. Right from taking prenatal vitamins to scheduling appointments with your obstetrician, a
                    healthy pregnancy denotes all you can start methodically. </p>

                <h3>Is walking a good pregnancy exercise?</h3>


                <p>Walking is a great, safe exercise for mums-to-be. It's an ideal way to make sure you're getting the
                    exercise you need in pregnancy.

                    Brisk walking works your heart and lungs, without jarring your knees and ankles. It's also a free
                    activity that you can easily incorporate into your daily life, so you'll be more likely to keep it
                    up.

                    For extra motivation, go for walks with friends and family. This can help to pass the time and
                    encourage you to walk for longer stretches.</p>
