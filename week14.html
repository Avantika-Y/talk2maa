        Welcome to the second trimester!
        At 14 weeks pregnant, many moms-to-be begin to feel hungrier, more energetic and less nauseous as early pregnancy symptoms 
        start to subside.
        Meanwhile, your baby's getting chubbier by the day, and may be starting to sprout some hair.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 14</h2>
    <h3>14 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're 14 weeks pregnant, you're in month 4 of your pregnancy. Only 5 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some 
        more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 14 weeks?</h3>
    <p>
        At 14 weeks, your baby is growing and developing rapidly, measuring between 3½ and 4 inches long and weighing around 2 ounces, 
        about the size of a navel orange.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby is standing up straight</h3>
    <p>
        Growing by leaps and bounds, your baby is leaping and bounding. Now the size of your clenched fist, she's on the move almost 
        constantly — and those movements are a far cry from those jerky twitches of last trimester (though you won't feel any of them 
        for weeks to come). They are now ballet-like, smooth and fluid.
        Speaking of ballet, it'll be years before you'll start nagging your offspring to stand up straight — but unbelievably, she is 
        doing it right now, without any prodding! No slouch anymore, your baby's neck is getting longer, helping her head stand more 
        erect. This gives your fetus a more straightened-out appearance.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's sprouting hair and lanugo</h3>
    <p>
        By week 14 of pregnancy, your baby could be sprouting some hair and those eyebrows are filling in too.
        Hair growth isn't limited to baby's head, though. She is also covered with a downy coating of hair called lanugo, largely there 
        for warmth.
        But it won't be there forever. As fat accumulates later on in your pregnancy — the baby's fat, not yours — it will take over 
        the function of keeping your little bean toasty, so most of the lanugo sheds. Some babies, especially those born early, still 
        have a fuzzy coating at delivery, but it disappears soon afterward.
        Other developments this week include a roof of her own — inside your baby's mouth, that is — as well as some digestive system 
        activity: Her intestines are producing meconium, which is the waste that will make up her first bowel movement after birth.

    <h2>Your Body at Week 14</h2>

<h3>One down, two to go!</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the second trimester — (almost) every pregnant woman's favorite, and for good reason! As many first trimester pregnancy 
    woes wane, you're most likely feeling a bit peppier and a lot more human. With any luck, your breasts aren't quite as tender as they 
    were last trimester and your energy level is making a comeback.
    More good news on the horizon: less morning sickness and fewer trips to the potty to pee. Even cooler is the fact that it may be 
    time to start hitting those maternity boutiques, because you may be starting to show — instead of looking like you've eaten too much 
    for lunch.
    That's because your uterus is finally rising out of the pelvic region and into your lower abdomen. You might even be able to feel 
    the top of your uterus, called the fundus, if you press down right above your pelvic bone in your lower abdomen. How amazing is that?
</p>
<h3>Your 14 weeks pregnant belly</h3>
<p>
    Now that you’re officially in your second trimester, it may be time to go maternity clothes shopping for real, as right around now 
    many women go from looking a little bloated to actually “popping.” 
    But remember: Your 14 weeks pregnant belly is normal no matter how big or small it is. All expectant women carry baby differently 
    depending on their height and figure, and whether this is their first pregnancy or not. So breathe a sigh of relief and know that 
    your baby bump at 14 weeks is perfect, no matter what it looks like! And of course, if you have any questions, check in with your 
    provider.
</p>
<h3>Round ligament pain</h3>
<div class="picture49">
    <img src="picture49.jpg">
</div>
<p>
    For some women, a possible side effect of uterine growth is what your OB/GYN would call round ligament pain. Basically, these are 
    pregnancy growing pains that feel like achy or sharp pains on one or both sides of the abdomen that begin to appear around 14 weeks 
    but can strike at any time during the second trimester.
    Here's why: The uterus is supported by thick bands of ligaments that run from the groin up the side of the abdomen. As your uterus 
    grows, the supporting ligaments stretch and thin out to accommodate the increasing weight. This weight pulls on the ligaments and 
    causes a sharp pain or a dull ache in your lower abdomen. It’s often more noticeable when you change positions suddenly or quickly 
    get up from sitting or lying down or when you cough or sneeze.
    The best way to bring relief? Put your feet up and rest in a comfortable position, which should ease the strain and the pain.
</p>
<h3>Staying healthy</h3>
<p>
    As if you didn't have enough pregnancy symptoms to contend with, you're also more susceptible to colds, flu and other bugs when 
    you're expecting. That's because nature wisely suppresses your immune system during pregnancy to keep your fetus — a foreigner to 
    your body — from being rejected.
    The key to staying healthy is to engage in some germ warfare. More than ever, the best defense is a strong offense, especially when 
    germs are being passed around your office or home like canapés.
    Wash your hands often — and carry liquid sanitizer for times when a sink's not handy — don't share drinks or food or toothbrushes 
    and avoid sick people like the plague. It's okay to banish a sick spouse to the couch.
    If you think you've caught something, check with your practitioner ASAP, who will treat what you've got with your special needs in 
    mind. If antibiotics are prescribed for a bacterial infection — they're useless against viruses like colds — don't hesitate to take 
    them because you've heard medications aren't safe during pregnancy. Many are — and getting better fast is the best medicine for 
    your baby.
</p>
<h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
<h3> Keep track of skin changes</h3>
<p>
    It’s not unusual for moles to develop or change right about now, thanks to pregnancy hormones.
    But it’s still a smart move to have them evaluated by your doctor. Always check in with your practitioner about any skin changes 
    you notice just to be safe.
</p>
<h3>Get moving!</h3>
<p>
    With your second trimester comes a burst of energy. Take advantage! Get your light-to-moderate exercise game on to cut your risk of 
    gestational diabetes and keep yourself and your baby-to-be healthy.
    The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends getting at least 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise 
    per day, at least five days a week. Just remember to avoid exercising on your back now that you're past the first trimester.
</p>
<h3>Remember to eat</h3>
<p>
    Are you so busy that you sometimes forget to eat? Put a few "have you fed your baby?" reminders wherever you spend a lot of time — 
    like on your dashboard, your computer screen and the bathroom mirror.
    If you're afraid to eat because you're still feeling queasy, know that nausea can actually be made worse by an empty stomach. 
    Fill your tummy slowly, starting with fluids like water, fruit juices, smoothies and soups, then move on to solids once you think 
    your tender tummy can handle it.
    Try eating small meals or snacks every two to three hours to help regulate your blood sugar levels and digestion, especially if 
    you're still dealing with morning sickness.
</p>
<h3>Skip the tattoos</h3>
<p>
    Thinking of commemorating your pregnancy by getting a tattoo? Think again. While not much of the ink or its particles will enter 
    your bloodstream, there is a risk of infection any time you get stuck with a needle. Not a good risk to take when you're trying to 
    stay healthy for two.
    Plus, a new tattoo that looks symmetrical on your skin might become lopsided or distorted after you regain your pre-pregnancy shape!
    If you already have a tattoo, no problem — just sit back and watch it stretch! Your bikini-line butterfly might just start soaring 
    like an eagle!
</p>
<h3>Get ready to gain weight</h3>
<div class="picture27">
    <img src="picture27.png">
</div>
<p>
    In your second trimester, your baby starts to grow in earnest. Your weight gain should pick up so that if you started your 
    pregnancy with a normal BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, you’d add a total of about 12 to 14 pounds (give or take) during this second trimester.
    For the healthiest results, keep an eye on the scale within reason — no need to get too obsessive. But what you don’t know can 
    throw your weight off-target. Try to weigh yourself at the same time every day (or every few days) before getting dressed or while 
    wearing the same clothes.
</p>
<h3>Shop smart at the grocery store</h3>
<p>
    When shopping for groceries, think fresh, not processed. Fresh foods naturally provide more vitamins and minerals, and they 
    contain less sugar, salt, calories, fat and additives than their processed counterparts.
    A notable exception to fresh-is-always-best: Frozen fruits and vegetables that aren't packed with sugar or salt are often at least 
    as nutritious, or even more so, than fresh produce. Ditto for the canned variety.
</p>
<h3>Choose pregnancy-proof workout gear</h3>
<p>
    The heat's on when you're expecting, thanks to a metabolism boost. So when dressing for exercise success, play it cool. 
    Wear loose, breathable, stretchable workout clothes during pregnancy, right down to your undies (which should be cotton).
    Choose a bra — perhaps a sports bra — that provides plenty of support for your larger breasts but that doesn't pinch once you get 
    moving.
    If your sneakers are showing their age, replace them now to minimize your chances of injury or falls. While you're at it, make sure 
    you're wearing the right sneakers for your fitness routine.
