        <h2>Mental wellbeing during pregnancy</h2>
        <img src="blog1.jpg" alt="post-1" class="center">
        <h3>How can pregnancy affect my mental health and wellbeing?</h3>
        <p>Preparing to have a baby is an exciting time, but also a challenging one. Don’t be surprised if you
            experience some emotional change at this time.

            It's normal to have some worries and fears about what's coming when you're pregnant. Many people feel quite
            stressed at this time, particularly when they know it's a big change that they can't fully prepare for or
            control.
<br>
            In addition, pregnancy itself can be stressful. As well as coping with hormonal and physical changes, you
            may feel stressed about things such as antenatal tests. You may feel especially worried you've had a bad
            experience before, such as a miscarriage.

            For these reasons, pregnancy can increase the likelihood of developing a mental health condition.</p>
        <h3>What mental health conditions can I experience during pregnancy?</h3>
        <p>Both partners can experience mental health conditions during the pregnancy (the 'antenatal' period), as well
            as after the birth (the 'postnatal' period).
            For some people, pregnancy can lead to conditions such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>depression</li>
            <li>anxiety</li>
            <li> bipolar disorder (less common)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Up to 1 in 10 females and 1 in 20 males experience antenatal depression. Antenatal anxiety is also common, and
        many people experience anxiety and depression at the same time.
        Certain factors can put you at greater risk of developing anxiety and depression during pregnancy. These
        include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a previous mental health condition</li>
            <li>feeling that you don't have enough support</li>
            <li>going through a hard time, such as in your relationship</li>
             <li>past or current abuse of any sort</li>
             <li>problems with drugs or alcohol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyone can have a mental health condition — it’s nothing to be ashamed about.</p>
        <h3>When is it time for me to get help?</h3>
        <p>It's a good idea for all expectant parents to monitor their mental health and wellbeing. Keep a lookout for
            signs that you may need help and be ready to take action if you need to.<br>

            While pregnancy has its ups and downs, it’s time to seek advice from a health professional if:</p>
        <ul>
           <li> you've felt consistently bad (for example, if you feel sad or worried) for longer than 2 weeks</li>
           <li> negative thoughts and feelings are starting to affect your ability to function normally</li>
           <li> you're showing signs of depression, such as losing interest, or feeling hopeless or unable to cope</li>
           <li> you feel anxious or worried most or all of the time</li>
           <li> you start having panic attacks, or develop obsessive or compulsive behaviours</li>
        </ul>
           <p> There’s lots of help available for mental health conditions during pregnancy. Your doctor or midwife can
            give you support and advice.</p>
        <h3>How can I manage my mental wellbeing during pregnancy?</h3>
        <p>There are plenty of things you can do to help manage your mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy.</p>
         <ul>
           <li> Don’t expect too much of yourself – be realistic about what you can do; rest when you need to.</li>
           <li> Try not to make major changes at this time, like moving house or changing jobs, unless you have to.</li>
           <li> Keep physically active (check with your doctor or midwife before you start an exercise program).</li>
           <li> Eat regular, healthy meals.</li>
           <li> Spend time with people who make you feel relaxed and good about yourself.</li>
           <li> Avoid using drugs or alcohol to deal with stress.</li>
           <li> Make connections with other expectant parents so you can support each other.</li>
            <li>Accept help if it’s offered to you; ask for help if you need it.</li>
        </ul>
