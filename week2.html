    <h1>1 and 2 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby has yet to be conceived.</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, your pregnancy journey begins now, even though you’re not actually pregnant yet.
         That’s because most practitioners start timing pregnancy based on the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP).
        In weeks 1 and 2 of pregnancy, your body is gearing up for ovulation and preparing for fertilization, which will happen in 
        week 3.
    </p>
    <h3>1 to 2 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re 1 and 2 weeks pregnant, you're in month 1 of your pregnancy. Only 8 months to go! Still have questions? Here's 
        some more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>Gearing up to ovulate</h3>
    <p>
        No, there’s no baby or embryo in sight. At least not yet — just an anxious egg and a whole bunch of eager sperm at their 
        respective starting gates.
        But in weeks 1 and 2 of pregnancy — the week of and immediately following your last menstrual period — your body is working 
        hard to gear up for the event that paves the way for baby: the big O, or ovulation.
        Right now, your uterus has begun preparing for the arrival of a fertilized egg, though you won't know for sure if that egg has
     successfully matched up with sperm until next month.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Body at Weeks 1 and 2</h2>

    <h3>Your last menstrual period</h3>
    <p>
        You've just gotten your last period, at least for a while: The lining of your uterus is shedding, taking with it last month's 
        unfertilized egg.But that's not all that's happening. A new cycle is beginning, one that is the starting point for your 
        pregnancy.
        Your menstrual cycle is orchestrated by a symphony of hormones working in concert with one another. The first to kick in
       is FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) which — you guessed it — stimulates the follicles to mature, some faster than others.
       A second hormone, lutenizing hormone (LH), increases around day 5 and also works with FSH to stimulate the follicles. Each 
       follicle contains an egg, and each month only one follicle becomes the dominant one, destined for ovulation.
       As the follicles mature, they produce another hormone, estrogen, which does two things. First, it encourages the lining of the 
       uterus to begin thickening again. Second, once a high enough level of estrogen is reached, it will trigger a spike in the production 
       of LH.
       That surge of LH causes the egg from the most mature follicle to burst through the ovarian wall (a process you probably know 
       best as ovulation, which generally occurs about 24 to 36 hours after the LH surge) to meet Mr. Right — the lucky sperm that will
       turn that eager egg into a baby-in-the-making and make your body's prep work worth all the effort.
       Believe it or not, the countdown to delivery day begins now, during the period before fertilization — even though egg and 
       sperm haven't even been in the same room (or womb!).
       And if you don't get pregnant this time around, don't stress: The average, healthy couple in their 20s and early 30s have about 
       a 25 to 30 percent chance of getting pregnant with each cycle.
      In the meantime, while your uterus is preparing for its new tenant, be a good landlord. Think of these two weeks of waiting as a 
      final walk-through before baby takes over the keys. You may not technically be pregnant yet, but it isn't too early to act like 
      you are. Start taking your prenatal vitamin, give up alcohol and smoking and embark on a healthy prenatal diet and exercise 
      routine.
      Turn down the heat to boost fertility.
      Trying to make a baby? Turn off that electric blanket and keep each other warm the good, old-fashioned way. Studies show that 
      prolonged, excessive heat — like the kind produced by electric blankets, heating pads, heated seats and even laptops that are 
      placed on a man's lap — can adversely affect those temperamental testes by slowing down sperm production (and you want sperm 
      aplenty right now!). Plus, all that snuggling you'll have to do to stay warm will generate the kind of heat that can actually
      make babies.
      More ways to increase your odds of scoring a fertilized egg: Try refraining from oral sex before the main event, since saliva 
      can have a negative impact on sperm activity and motility … and you want them alive and kicking. Ditto for most lubricants, so 
      lay off the Astroglide while you're trying to conceive.

    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Fill up on folic acid</h3>
    <div class="picturetwo">
        <img src="picture2.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        There's no doubt that your body works overtime when you're expecting — so help give it the extra nutrients it needs to 
        baby-build by getting 400 to 600 micrograms of folic acid daily from all sources, including your prenatal vitamin and 
        folate-rich foods.
        Research has shown that taking folic acid beginning when you’re trying to get pregnant and continuing daily throughout 
        pregnancy not only helps you conceive but has important health benefits for expecting women and their babies.
        Folic acid (and its natural form, folate) can help reduce the risk of birth defects including congenital heart and neural 
        tube defects in your baby, and has even been shown to lower your chances of gestational diabetes, preterm labor and miscarriage.
    </p>
    <h3>Ask your doc about meds</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re taking a prescription, OTC or herbal med, ask your doctor ASAP about whether it’s safe to continue it during 
        pregnancy.
        Herbal preparations are not tested or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are not required to undergo 
        clinical trials. Translation: Their safety, or lack thereof, is unknown.
        Even herbs that you've heard could be helpful during pregnancy may be harmful at some point during the next nine months. 
        So always get the green light from your practitioner before taking any medication or herbal supplement of any kind.
    </p>
    <h3>Spot early pregnancy signs</h3>
    <p>
        You could be weeks away from taking a pregnancy test, but Mother Nature may give you a heads-up in the form of early pregnancy 
        symptoms.
        Some, like a heightened sense of smell and tender breasts, can show up before you even miss your period, while others, like 
        spotting and urinary frequency, happen a week or two after conception.
        Haven't noticed any new symptoms? Plenty of women won't feel any until at least a few weeks or more into their pregnancies — and
        some lucky few won't notice any at all!
    </p>
    <h3>Shop for pregnancy tests</h3>
    <p>
        You're already imagining the moment when those magical double lines, plus signs or “yes” answers appear on your home pregnancy 
        test. But before you get to that point, you'll have to navigate the drugstore aisles to choose the one you like best.
        One question you might have: Are cheap pregnancy tests any different from expensive ones? Not really. All home pregnancy tests
        work the same way — by measuring the levels of the pregnancy hormone hCG — and are up to 99 percent accurate if you follow the
        instructions.
        Some pricier tests might be more sensitive to hCG than others, or work a little faster. But rest assured, whether you choose a 
        $5 or $25 test, your results will be equally accurate.
        You can also check our shop section for some of the best kits.
    </p>
    <h3>Brush up on your pregnancy hormone knowledge</h3>
    <p>
        Your hormones will be to blame for pretty much every pregnancy symptom you'll experience for the next nine months or so — which 
        is why it makes sense to familiarize yourself with some of the major pregnancy players.
        Stuffy nose? Credit all that extra estrogen, which is helping the uterus grow and baby's organs form. Facial fuzz sprouting? 
        Thank prolactin, which helps enlarge your breasts and kickstarts lactation.
        Achy back and joints? That would be the handiwork of the hormone relaxin, which (true to its name), helps loosen the muscles,
         joints and ligaments in your body to prepare for labor.
    </p>
    <h3>Are those signs of conception...or just PMS?</h3>
    <p>
        Early pregnancy signs — like bloating, fatigue and tender breasts — are remarkably similar to PMS symptoms and can appear the
         week before your last period arrives.
         Other symptoms, like a consistently creamy vaginal discharge or an elevated basal body temperature (BBT), are usually signs of
        pregnancy, but can be tricky to detect.
        One symptom that only appears during pregnancy: a change in your areola's color or size (they'll look darker or wider).
    </p>
    <h3>Look for signs of ovulation</h3>
    <p>
        Be an ovulation detective. At peak fertility — which, depending on how long your menstrual cycle lasts, is 11 to 21 days from 
        the first day of your last period — your cervical mucus increases and becomes thinner, gooey and slippery.
        To figure out when you're ovulating, you can use an at-home test called an ovulation predictor kit, which works by measuring the
        levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine.
        Other signs of ovulation to watch out for include slightly lower basal body temperature (that then rises again), light spotting,
        cramps in your lower abdomen and an increased sex drive.
