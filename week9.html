        Feeling exhausted? Fatigue kicks in for many moms-to-be around week 9 of pregnancy. The (very important) reason? Your body is 
        working overtime in the first trimester to develop the placenta, the lifeline between your baby and your own blood supply.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 9</h2>
    <h3>9 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're 9 weeks pregnant, you're in month 3 of your pregnancy. Only 6 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some 
        more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 9 weeks?</h3>
    <p>
        At 9 weeks pregnant, your little one is now about 1 inch long, the size of a medium green olive — but no martinis, please.
    </p>
    <h3>The embryo period ends</h3>
    <p>
        Would you believe your baby is only an embryo for one more week and is already developing into a fetus?
        The head has straightened out and is more fully developed and the ears are continuing to grow, making baby look more human. 
        Plus, toes are visible, and all of baby's essential organs, like the heart, brain, kidneys, liver and lungs, have begun to 
        develop.
        The arms and legs in your soon-to-be-fetus are also spontaneously moving now that minuscule muscles are beginning to develop, 
        though you won't feel your tiny dancer for at least another month or two.
    </p>
    <h3>Fetal cardiac activity is audible on ultrasound</h3>
    <p>
        While it's way too early to feel anything, it's not too early to possibly hear something. Your baby's heart is developed 
        enough — and has grown large enough — for cardiac activity to be heard with a Doppler, a handheld ultrasound device.
        But don't worry if your practitioner can't pick up the sound yet. It just means your shy guy is hiding in the corner of your 
        uterus or has his back facing out, making it hard for the Doppler to find its target. In a few weeks, or at your next visit, 
        that miraculous sound is certain to be audible for your listening pleasure.
    </p>

    <h3>Feeling so tired!</h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to pregnancy symptoms, you may feel like you've already reached your limit at 9 weeks pregnant: Your clothes are 
        getting tighter around the waist, you're busting out on top and you're still running to the bathroom 100 times a day — and if it 
        isn't because you're sick, it's to pee.
        But wait, there's more. You're having trouble lifting your head off the pillow, you're dragging your feet all day and you can't 
        wait to crawl into bed as soon as you arrive home at night.
        Sound familiar? Extreme pregnancy fatigue is a common symptom, especially in the first trimester. And for good reason: Making a 
        baby is hard work. Your body is working overtime preparing for motherhood as it develops the placenta, your baby's lifeline.
        What's more, your body's metabolism and hormone levels have increased significantly, which triggers a decrease in blood sugar 
        and blood pressure — a recipe for fatigue. Try these tips to combat fatigue safely during pregnancy.
        The good news: Relief is around the corner as your energy level increases and morning sickness decreases over the next few weeks, 
        once placenta construction is completed in the second trimester.
        The not-so-good news: Tiredness is likely to reappear during the third trimester as the demands of toting around a larger fetus 
        increase. But since staying active is important for your health (and your baby's!), try these tips to work out when you're tired 
        during pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>Snacking well</h3>
    <div class="picture24">
        <img src="picture24.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        Even if you're still grappling with morning sickness, try not to worry too much. Your baby will still get the necessary 
        nutrients to grow and develop.
        Focus on eating six mini-meals or snacks rather than three big meals a day. And snack smart to satisfy your baby's and your 
        nutritional needs without offending your less-than-settled tummy.
        Snacks like saltine or whole grain crackers topped with mild cheese, ginger in various forms (tea, ginger ale, candy or even 
        small meals cooked with fresh ginger), applesauce, bananas, plain toast or bread, and modest servings of plain rice or pasta 
        can all do the trick.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Fight heartburn</h3>
    <div class="picture33">
        <img src="picture33.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        Are you feeling the burn — heartburn, that is? For many, heartburn is among the earliest symptoms of pregnancy, beginning around 
        the second month.
        If avoiding spicy and greasy foods isn’t helping, try taking antacids. They contain extra calcium, which you need during 
        pregnancy anyway.
    </p>
    <h3>Ask about genetic tests</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re 35 or older or if you have a family history of genetic conditions, now’s the time to consider talking to your doctor 
        about common genetic screenings, including NIPT (noninvasive prenatal testing), performed after 9 weeks, and CVS (chorionic 
        villus sampling), performed between 10 and 13 weeks.
    </p>
    <h3>Get your Zzzs</h3>
    <p>
        If your favorite sleep position is tummy-down, that’s perfectly fine — at least,until your tummy is the size of a watermelon, 
        at which point you’ll have to switch positions for obvious reasons.
        During the second and and third trimesters, sleeping on your side is ideal for you and your baby-to-be.
        This position allows for maximum blood flow and nutrients to the placenta, since it puts less pressure on a large vein called 
        the vena cava, and enhances kidney function.
    </p>
    <h3>Fill up on fiber</h3>
    <div class="picture34">
        <img src="picture34.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        Fiber-rich foods — aka roughage — will help you eliminate waste. Eat whole grains, fresh or dried fruits, vegetables, beans and 
        peas.
        Going for the green can also help you go — and you don't have to rely only on vegetables: A kiwi, for example, packs a potent 
        laxative effect. Aim for 25 to 35 grams of fiber each day, but try to ease into it if you don't eat a lot of fiber already.
        On the flip side, be sure to cut back on those classic cloggers: refined grains, like white bread, white rice and refined 
        cereals and pasta.
    </p>
     <h3>Get more mileage out of your clothes</h3>
     <div class="picture35">
        <img src="picture35.jpg">
    </div>
     <p>
        Sooner or later, every pregnant woman enters that period of fashion limbo. Right now, you're too big for your jeans but too 
        small for maternity wear.
        So get creative: Thread a rubber band around your jeans button, through the buttonhole and back around the button again or buy 
        a belly band, which can hide your unbuttoned pants and smooth out your silhouette.
        Or keep your skirt partially unzipped in the back and wear a blouse, sweater or jacket over it to hide the evidence. You'll get 
        a couple more weeks of mileage out of your favorites that way.
        When you're ready to venture into the world of maternity fashion, be savvy about your wardrobe. Buy as you grow, look beyond the 
        maternity department for cute stuff that fits and don't sacrifice your personal style!
     </p>
    <h3>Prevent constipation</h3>
     <p>
        Constipation — it's one pregnancy symptom that no one wants to talk about.
        Need some tips to get things moving? First, scrutinize your supplements. Ironically, many of the supplements that do a pregnant 
        body good (prenatal vitamins, calcium and iron supplements) can also contribute to constipation.
        Talk to your practitioner about possible alternatives, such as a slow-release formula, an iron-free prenatal or a vitamin that 
        contains a stool softener. You can also get things going more smoothly by fitting in some kind of exercise (a brisk walk, yoga) 
        daily.
        And don't forget, when you gotta go — go. As soon as possible. Holding it in can weaken your bowel muscles, making it harder to 
        push out the poop. And remember to stay away from medications, including herbal ones, until you've checked in with your 
        practitioner.
     </p>
     <h3>Use cold compresses</h3>
     <p>
        Breast tenderness is extremely common among the pregnant set, with symptoms ranging from a dull ache to feelings of fullness and 
        sharp, shooting pains.
        There's a reason for all this activity, though: Your body is building fat and increasing blood flow to the area, which will help 
        prime you for breastfeeding once baby is here.
        Until the pain subsides — usually in the second or third trimester — apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to your breasts. Or, 
        if you prefer heat, take a warm (not hot) shower.
