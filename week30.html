    <h1>30 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby is as big as a beet(including the leaves).</h2>

    <p>Your baby is filling out fast at 30 weeks of pregnancy, meaning your bump may be popping even more now. A big part of that growth is in baby's rapidly developing brain.

        Meanwhile, you may be welcoming back a few of those early pregnancy symptoms you thought you'd kissed good-bye at the end of the first trimester, such as frequent urination.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 30</h2>
    <h3>30 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>If you're 30 weeks pregnant, you're in month 7 of your pregnancy. Only 2 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.

    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 30 weeks?</h3>
    <p>Your belly's increasing size is a definite clue that your baby is getting bigger every day — now she’s weighing in at about 3 pounds. She’ll be packing on weight at a rate of roughly half a pound per week for the next seven weeks.

    </p>
    <h3>Baby's brain is getting bigger</h3>
    <p>Also growing at a quick pace these days? Baby's brain. Until now, its surface was smooth — but now, your fetus' brain is taking on those characteristic grooves and indentations.

        The reason for the different appearance: Those wrinkles allow for an increased amount of brain tissue — a necessary change as your baby prepares to develop street smarts for life outside your womb.
    </p>
    <h3>Lanugo is disappearing</h3>
    <p>Now that baby’s brain and new fat cells are regulating body temperature, the lanugo — that soft, downy hair covering your little bean's body — is beginning to disappear.

        No need for that furry coat anymore! But you may see a few leftover strands of fur on your newborn's back and shoulders when she’s born.
    </p>
    <h3>Bone marrow is making red blood cells</h3>
    <p>Another big change at 30 weeks pregnant: Your baby's bone marrow has completely taken over production of red blood cells — before, tissue groups and then the spleen took care of producing the blood cells. This is an important step for your baby because it means she'll be better able to thrive on her own once she's born.

    </p>

    <h3>They're baaack!</h3>
    <p>You're 30 weeks pregnant — only 10 more to go! Many of the early pregnancy symptoms you thought you'd put behind you may be coming back to haunt you, at least to some extent, like the need to pee all the time because your baby's head is now pressing on your bladder, tender breasts that are gearing up for milk production, fatigue and pregnancy heartburn.

        Or you may be one of the lucky ones who still feels pretty great — just remember that it's all normal, and everyone is different!
    </p>
    <h3>Heartburn</h3>
    <div class="picture17">
        <img src="picture17.png">
    </div>
    <p>These days you may feel as though you've got a flamethrower in your chest. Indigestion is one of the most common (and annoying) pregnancy ailments.

        Here's why: The same pregnancy hormones that cause your body's pelvic muscles to relax so you can deliver your baby also relax the ring of muscle that separates the esophagus from the stomach.
        
        The result: Food and digestive juices can head upstream from your tummy into your chest and throat — hence, the infernal inferno. Your expanding uterus, now exerting pressure on your stomach, only fuels the fire.
        
        So how do you spell relief? Among other things, avoid foods that can cause digestive discomfort — like spicy, fatty or fried dishes, chocolate and tomato sauce — eat smaller meals and don't lie down while snacking or right after eating. And, of course, keep a supply of Tums or Rolaids, which also give you a healthy bonus of calcium, at popping distance.
        
        Fortunately, once your baby is born, heartburn will be a thing of the past — at least until you try to gobble dinner during a colic marathon.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Prop up with pillows</h3>
    <p>Breathless? Your growing baby is pressing against your diaphragm. As your pregnancy progresses, you may start to feel winded even after minimal amounts of physical exertion.

        You can’t completely relieve shortness of breath during pregnancy, but standing up straight can give your lungs a little, well, breathing room. At night, try sleeping in a semi-seated position on your left side, with pillows propping you up.
    </p>
    <h3>Opt for flats</h3>
    <p>Put away the heels! Your shifting sense of gravity and loosening joints (thanks to that all-important hormone, relaxin) leave you clutzier than usual. Prevent falls by wearing flats and watching your step.

    </p>
    <h3>Ask about episiotomies</h3>
    <p>Talk to your health care provider about episiotomies during labor. The procedure involves a surgical cut in your perineum, the muscular area between your vagina and your anus, right before delivery to enlarge your baby's exit.

        In the past, episiotomies were routine, but now, they’re done much less often unless there’s a good reason. What you want to hear from your doctor: "I only perform them if absolutely necessary."
    </p>
    <h3>Remember your Kegels</h3>
    <p>The name Kegel may be silly — at least when you say it out loud — but these pelvic floor strengthening exercises really work wonders.

        Why? A stronger pelvic floor better supports your uterus, bladder and bowels, and it can ease pregnancy and postpartum symptoms such as hemorrhoids and urinary incontinence. More good news: Kegel exercises are easy to do no matter where you are.
        
        To give them a shot, tense the muscles around your vagina and bottom and hold, same as you would if you were trying to stop the flow of urine, working up to 10 seconds. Then slowly release and repeat. Shoot for three sets of 20 daily. Try doing them during sex too.
    </p>
    <h3>Combat water retention</h3>
    <p>Here's a “swell” reason to drink water: Though most people associate lots of water with water weight, the opposite is actually true. Paradoxically, drinking plenty of liquids can keep excessive water retention and swelling under control.

        While a certain amount of pregnancy edema is to be expected when you're expecting — and represents a normal and necessary increase in body fluids — keeping the fluids flowing (as well as cutting back on your salt intake) can prevent too many from accumulating where you'd rather they didn't…like in your ankles. Support stockings can also help reduce swelling, as can soaking in epsom baths and swimming.
    </p>
    <h3>Check skin care products</h3>
    <p>efore you treat those fine lines on your face, read the fine print on your skin care products’ ingredient labels. If they contain vitamin A (retinoids) or BHA (beta hydroxy acid or salicylic acid), you might need to bid it a fond farewell for a while — though check with your doctor to be sure.

        Most practitioners will green-light products containing AHA (alpha hydroxy acid), but do ask first. And keep in mind that AHA products can make your already sun-sensitive pregnancy skin even more vulnerable to the damaging effects of the sun’s rays.
        
        Sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher is your friend, so wear it daily, even when there are more clouds than sun. Not only will you protect your skin, you’ll ward off wrinkles more effectively than any cream at any price.
    </p>
    <h3>Choose safe sugar substitutes</h3>
    <p>Choose safe sugar substitutes</p>
    <p>Sucralose (Splenda), which has less of an aftertaste, appears to be safe during pregnancy, so you can sweeten your day — and your coffee or tea — with it.

    </p>
    <p>Aspartame (including Equal and NutraSweet) has experts divided. Some think it’s harmless, while others think it's unsafe. Given this lack of consensus, it's probably smart not to give Equal equal billing with other sweetener options.

    </p>
    <p>Saccharin (like Sweet ‘N Low) has never been proven unsafe during pregnancy, but it's never been proven safe either. It gets to your baby through the placenta, and when it gets there, it's slow to leave. To be safe, avoid it while you’re expecting, or at the very least, check with your doctor before using it.

    </p>
    <p>Xylitol is a sugar alcohol derived from plants that's naturally occurring in many fruits and veggies and is considered safe during pregnancy in moderate amounts.

    </p>
    <p>Stevia (steviol glycoside) is a food additive that’s "generally recognized as safe," and therefore doesn't need approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but there's no research showing that it's okay for pregnancy. Ask before using it.

    </p>
    <p>Your best bet? Check with your practitioner before using any of these sugar substitutes. And just remember: When it comes to artificial sweeteners, consumption in moderation is always a good idea and you may be better off just using the real thing (sugar) in small amounts.
