        <h2>Best Healthy Pregnancy Snacks to Satisfy Your Cravings</h2>
        <img src="blog2.png" alt="post-1" class="center">
        <h3>Healthy dry snacks for pregnancy:</h3>
        <p>Sure, a cup of yogurt or a smoothie can be a nice pick-me-up. But sometimes you need a dry option that’s easy
            to transport and can sit in your bag for hours without needing to be refrigerated.

            In addition to being convenient, dry snacks often contain whole grains, nuts and dried fruit, so they’re a
            great way to get more fiber into your diet to help prevent pregnancy constipation, as well as fill up on
            protein and B vitamins. Dry snacks also tend to be pretty easy to eat when you’re queasy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trail mix. The nut, seed and dried fruit combo has protein, healthy fats and fiber to keep you going for
                hours. Add some fun mix-ins like cashews, pumpkin seeds, dried cherries or dark chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Granola bars. Think of them as trail mix in bar form with the addition of hearty, fiber-packed oats.
                Some granola bars can be as sweet as desserts, however, so look for options made with real fruits and
                nuts. </li>
            <li>Whole grain pretzels. To confirm that yours are truly made with whole grains, check the label. If the
                first ingredient listed contains the word "whole" (like "whole wheat" or "whole oats") you’re probably
                good to go.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Healthy protein snacks for pregnancy:</h3>
        <p>Protein is vital for your baby’s growth and development, but it’ll also help keep your blood sugar levels
            stable — which can keep you fueled longer and stave off low blood sugar symptoms like headaches, nausea and
            irritability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hummus and whole wheat crackers. You’ll get protein and healthy fats from the chickpea dip, plus
                wholesome carbs from the crackers. For a bigger appetite, add some sliced raw veggies and a handful of
                olives.</li>
            <li>Edamame. The savory soybean pods are loaded with protein and fiber, along with iron, folate and
                magnesium. To boost the flavor, warm the pods in the microwave and sprinkle with salt and sesame seeds.
            </li>
            <li>A handful of nuts. High in protein, fiber and healthy fats, nuts might just be nature’s perfect snack.
                Each type of nut has its own nutritional perks (almonds offer calcium, walnuts have omega-3s and peanuts
                serve up vitamin E), so aim for a variety. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Healthy sweet pregnancy snacks:</h3>
        <p>It’sperfectly fine to treat yourself to the occasional cookie or brownie. But if your sweet tooth tends to
            rear its head on a regular basis, it’s worth having a handful of healthy (and still satisfying) options at
            the ready.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medjool dates with almond butter. Sweet and sticky, dates are truly nature’s candy. Add an extra layer
                of deliciousness — and make them more filling — by dunking the dates into protein-packed almond butter.
            </li>
            <li>Frozen banana "ice cream" with chopped nuts. Process a chopped, frozen banana in the food processor
                until smooth to make a creamy, naturally sweet ice cream that tastes just like the real thing. Top with
                chopped walnuts and a cherry for a sundae-like treat.</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate and a clementine. Aim for chocolate containing 70 to 85 percent cocoa. The higher cocoa
                content means your chocolate will have more nutrients (like iron and magnesium) and less added sugar.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Healthy evening snacks for pregnancy:</h3>
        <p>Plagued by a rumbling tummy before bed? Pick a light, easy-to-digest option with nutrients that will help
            lull you to sleep.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole grain cereal with milk. The combo of complex carbs and protein will help you feel sleepy. Again,
                stick with cereal options containing fewer than 10 grams of sugar per serving. Not only are they more
                nutritious, but eating lots of sugar right before bed might keep you awake. </li>
            <li>Whole wheat peanut butter toast with a banana. The complex carb-protein combo might be sleep-inducing,
                especially when you add a few slices of banana, another fruit source of melatonin. </li>
            <li>A handful of walnuts. In addition to their protein, healthy fats and omega-3s, eating walnuts can boost
                your blood levels of melatonin and help you sleep more soundly.</li>

        </ul>
