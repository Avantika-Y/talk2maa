    <h1>10 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby is as big as a prune.</h2>
    <div class="picture32">
        <img src="picture32.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        You’re now in month 3 of your pregnancy, and your baby has officially graduated from an embryo to a fetus. You may just be 
        starting to show at 10 weeks pregnant (though if there are no signs of a bump yet, that’s normal too), and you might also
         notice visible veins and increased vaginal discharge.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 10</h2>
    <h3>10 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're 10 weeks pregnant, you're in month 3 of your pregnancy. Only 6 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some 
        more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 10 weeks?</h3>
    <p>
        Your baby's growth is fast and furious when you are 10 weeks pregnant. She's nearly 1½ inches long and the size of a prune, but 
        not nearly as shriveled — even with all the time spent in water.
    </p>
    <h3>The start of the fetal period</h3>
    <div class="picture36">
        <img src="picture36.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        Congratulations! Your baby has officially graduated this week from embryo to fetus.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's bones form</h3>
    <p>
        Your baby is really taking a human shape now. Bones and cartilage are forming and small indentations on the legs are developing 
        into knees and ankles. The arms, complete with elbows, can flex already — how's that for magical?
        Still, don't run to the store for a baseball bat just yet. Though your baby's arms are taking shape and getting stronger, 
        each one is still teeny-tiny.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's first teeth</h3>
    <p>
        The tooth bud fairy is making an appearance this week, heralding the arrival of your baby's little choppers, which are forming 
        under the gums. But those pearly whites won't break through the gums until your baby is close to 6 months old.
        Other systems are a go, too. Your baby's stomach is producing digestive juices, the kidneys are producing larger quantities of 
        urine and, if it's a boy, your little one is already producing testosterone.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Body at Week 10</h2>
    <div class="pictureone">
        <img src="pictureone.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>Symptoms may persist</h3>
    <p>
        You may still be noticing some of those fun pregnancy symptoms sticking around. All clogged up? For many moms-to-be, those pesky 
        pregnancy hormones cause the smooth muscles of the large bowel to fall down on the job — they get sluggish and you get 
        constipated. 
        Fiber in the form of whole grains, fruits and veggies can help, as can drinking lots of water and exercising regularly.
        Still coping with nausea and vomiting? Your doctor may suggest one or more of these morning sickness remedies.
    </p>
    <h3>Your 10 weeks pregnant belly</h3>
    <div class="picture37">
        <img src="picture37.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        If you haven't already looked in the mirror lately and examined your newly pregnant body and your 10 weeks pregnant belly, take 
        a deep breath, take off your clothes and go for it.
        First thing you're likely to notice at 10 weeks pregnant is a slightly rounder lower abdomen.
        In other words, at 10 weeks pregnant, you may be just starting to show. That’s because your ever-growing uterus is now somewhat 
        larger than a grapefruit. But don't worry if you can't quite see your bump at 10 weeks yet — you will soon enough.
        Remember that pretty much anything is normal when it comes to your baby bump. Some women show earlier and others show later 
        depending on their height, weight and build. If it’s your first pregnancy, you may show a bit later than if it’s your second 
        (or third!) pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned, but don’t worry. Pretty much anything goes!
    </p>
    <h3>Visible veins</h3>
    <p>
        Second thing you might notice are all those blue lines that have suddenly appeared on your skin, crisscrossing your breasts and 
        abdomen.
        These visible veins can appear on both light and dark complexions. What you're seeing is the expanded network of veins that's 
        carrying the increased blood supply needed to nourish your growing fetus.
        As your pregnancy progresses, you'll also notice that the veins in your hands and feet seem larger and more prominent, too. 
        During pregnancy, the average woman's blood volume increases by a little under 50 percent and the veins have to keep up so they 
        can go with the flow.
        So consider those blue lines on your body to be a pregnancy badge of honor: Wear them with pride and with the comforting 
        knowledge that they'll disappear for good once your baby's born and you're no longer breastfeeding (if you do).
    </p>
    <h3>Curing constipation</h3>
    <p>
        Constipation is an all-too-common first trimester pregnancy symptom. What can you do about it? First, steer clear of foods 
        that'll clog up the works like refined white breads, rice and pasta. Second, fixate on fiber: Choose whole grains, like 
        fiber-rich cereals, and fresh fruit, like kiwis — a fine, furry friend to those who are constipated.
        Dried fruit, too, is a great option. Beyond that geriatric favorite, prunes, try all your favorite fruits dried — apricots, 
        peaches, pears, apples, blueberries, cherries…you name it! Or, choose raw or lightly cooked vegetables and nuts and seeds.
        Third, wash that fiber down — and through your system — with plenty of fluids, particularly water and juice. If you close 
        your eyes, V8 tastes just like champagne! Well, sort of.
        And finally, remember that getting moving can keep things moving — another good reason to put exercise on the agenda. If the 
        situation doesn't improve in a couple of days, swallow your pride and call your practitioner, who may have a few special tricks 
        up that white-coated sleeve. Don't use any over-the-counter remedies without consulting your doctor first.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Take the ride in stride</h3>
    <p>
        Crying uncontrollably one minute, laughing hysterically the next? These emotional highs and lows are par for the pregnancy 
        course.
        Mood swings are mostly felt during the first trimester, with a second trimester break. But be forewarned: They often return 
        for the last few months of pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>Avoid triggering smells</h3>
    <p>
        Thanks to a much more sensitive sense of smell, you may find once-appetizing aromas suddenly offensive — and offensive ones 
        downright sickening.
        So stay away from any smells that trigger nausea as much as possible — whether it’s the sausage and eggs your partner likes to 
        make on the weekends or the cologne or perfume that used to make you head over heels but now makes you head for the toilet.
        Steer clear, too, of foods that you can’t stand the sight of. Raw chicken, for example, is a common culprit.
    </p>
    <h3>Ask your doc about the COVID-19 vaccine</h3>
    <p>When you’re pregnant, you’re at an increased risk for complications from COVID-19, so it’s smart to practice social distancing 
        and wear a face mask in public, especially when you’re inside.
        You may also want to be vaccinated with the COVID-19 shot, which is currently available to all adults, including pregnant 
        people.
        Experts say that the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna as well as the viral vector vaccine from Johnson & Johnson 
        are unlikely to pose any harm to an unborn baby — and note that the risks of getting COVID-19 while pregnant are likely to be 
        higher than the potential risks of getting the vaccine.
        Ultimately, however, the decision is a personal one. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Add mangoes to your plate</h3>
    <div class="picture38">
        <img src="picture38.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        All fruits are good for you, but mangoes are particularly great for the pregnant set. They contain more vitamins A and C 
        bite-for-delicious-bite than a salad.
        This tropical favorite, also packed with potassium, is especially versatile — a perfect complement to sweet and savory dishes. 
        Blend it into smoothies or soups, chop it up in salsas or relishes, or simply scoop and enjoy.
    </p>
    <h3>Photograph your bump</h3>
    <p>
        Is your pregnant belly ready for its close-up? Someday you'll enjoy looking at pictures or videos of your baby bump — and so 
        will your child.
        Once a month, document your changing figure and wear an outfit that lets your shape shine. Start now, before you really start to 
        expand, and take photos regularly until you deliver. Once you're done, create a pregnancy album — you'll be glad you did.
    </p>
    <h3>Know that fatigue is normal</h3>
    <p>
        Are your two favorite pastimes sitting and lying down? Pregnancy fatigue is normal. That's because you're running a baby-making 
        factory that's in business 24/7, causing your pregnant body to work harder at rest than your non-pregnant body did on the run.
        And for the next few weeks, a baby's not the only thing in production — so is the placenta, the magnificently complex mission 
        control that will serve as your baby's life support system until delivery. The result? You feel tired and overworked, even when
        you’re not doing a darn thing.
        Your energy should return once the placenta's up and running and your system adjusts as best as it can to the hormonal changes 
        of pregnancy — probably early in the second trimester.
        In the meantime, keep your blood-sugar levels up with frequent snacks of complex carbs and protein, like cheese and crackers or 
        nuts and dried fruit. Or try a little exercise, which can actually give you an energy boost. Most of all — listen to your body. 
        When it calls for a break, take one.
    </p>
    <h3>Eat a healthy breakfast</h3>
    <div class="picture39">
        <img src="picture39.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        If you haven't already, it's a fine time to get into the habit of eating breakfast and including two breakfast foods that are 
        especially good for your pregnant body and baby-building: oatmeal and DHA-enriched eggs.
        Oats are full of fiber, B vitamins, iron and a host of other good-for-you-minerals. Fill your breakfast bowl with them, but 
        don't stop there. Add oats — and all their nutritional superpowers — to pancakes and muffins (and cakes, cookies and even 
        meatloaf).
        If you're eating eggs, that's great. The old egg is still a good egg, delivering a low-calorie, high-protein punch in a tasty 
        little bundle.
        But you can boost the nutritional value by scrambling, frying or boiling ones enriched with DHA, a type of omega-3 fatty acid 
        and "good fat." It's a primary component of the brain and retina and is essential for brain development and eye formation in 
        the fetus.
