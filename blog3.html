        <h2>How can I take care of myself during pregnancy?</h2>
        <img src="blog3.jpg" alt="post-1" class="center">
        <h3>How much weight gain is normal or essential in pregnancy?</h3>
        <p>Your obstetrician or midwife will guide you about healthy weight gain. It happens to be different for
            everyone. Nonetheless, most women gain about 25 to 30 pounds. Underweight women may have to gain more weight
            as directed by their obstetrician. Being overweight or underweight demands different dietary interventions.
            It may further depend upon various parameters like your BMI and medical history.</p>

        <h3>How do you wish to begin your journey?</h3>
        <p>A journey that starts with the first trimester spans 9 months of ecstasy and a bit of nervousness. Start with
            an appointment with your obstetrician. Schedule an appointment immediately as you find that you have
            sprained your ankle. Your obstetrician will start with knowing about your medical history. Doctors may ask
            you about the symptoms you developed after your pregnancy began. Your obstetrician may subsequently give you
            some invaluable pregnancy tips on safety and nutrition. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Start with quitting smoking:</b>That's the best thing you can ever do for yourself and your baby.
                Countless studies worldwide show that women exposed to smoke are less likely to conceive. They may not
                carry their pregnancy to term even if they conceive. And smoking predisposes you to grave complications
                in labour. Studies associate smoking with an increased risk of having a premature baby or stillbirth.
                It's perhaps the best time to kick the butt. </li>
                <li><b>Start practising a lifestyle full of hygiene and sanitation:</b> Wash your hands frequently. Use a soap preferably recommended by your obstetrician or midwife. The importance of hygiene and sanitation is growing day by day. Make sure that your hands are thoroughly sanitized before and after every meal. Trim your nails frequently. Personal hygiene helps you prevent infections and transmitting them to the baby.</li>
                    <li><b>Mild physical activity in pregnancy:</b>You may consider joining a pregnancy exercise class. Many yoga classes held today will give you the right knowledge on exercise in pregnancy. It's great to exercise every day unless you have issues regularizing your exercise. Exercise helps you thrive on a healthy lifestyle and avoid tedium. Try to exercise for 30 minutes every day. Enjoy slow walks in the garden or lawn instead of brisk walks. Swimming is another choice that makes your day. Hydrating yourself is mandatory to assure that you don't suffer from heats or dehydration. Dehydration is a common concern in the second trimester. Avoid any exercises causing a fall or skid. Wear skid-proof footwear.  </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How would you avoid or cope with the common pregnancy concerns?</h3>
        <p>
           <ul>
            <li><b>Morning sickness:</b>Nauseous sensations are common mostly in the broad daylight during pregnancy. It's better to plan small meals and eat them exactly as planned. Avoid anything that tastes spicy or acidic. Acidic foods may complicate your morning sickness in various ways. It's better to confide in your obstetrician or midwife if your morning sickness lasts longer than 3 months. Morning sickness and weight loss may be the signs that foretell complications. Bring those to your obstetrician's notice if weight loss accompanies 3 extensive months of morning sickness. </li>
        <li><b>Muscle cramps:</b>Muscle cramps or leg cramps may not be there to stay. If mild physical activity accompanies your midwife's suggestions, you may avoid leg cramps easily. Stretch the calves of your legs by flexing your feet towards your knees. Drink plenty of water as directed by your obstetrician.</li> 
      <li><b>Tiredness:</b>Nothing is as common as tiredness and doldrums when you are pregnant. Take naps each time you feel overridden by doldrums. Make sure you aren't anaemic. If you are anaemic, take every necessary precaution as your obstetrician guides you. </li>  
    </ul> 
        </p>
        <h3>It's better to jot down all:</h3>
        <p>You may have many things to consider as you conceive and start nearing childbirth. You may take many things into account. Think about your medical history, your preferences, your current health status and your immediate surroundings. Write down all you wish to follow and include.<br><b>Following are the things you may consider including in your diary:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>How would you include pain medications?</li>
            <li>Special clothes you wish to wear</li>
            <li>Your favourite music/tracks</li>
            <li>Positions you prefer for labour and childbirth</li>
            <li>If you wish to avoid any procedures</li>
            <li>Plans to cope with complications if you have a medical history as such
            </li>
        </ol>
