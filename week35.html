    <h1>35 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby is as big as a bunch of Swiss chard.</h2>
    <div class="picture90">

    <p>At the 35-week mark, you're wrapping up month 8 of your pregnancy with one month left to go.

        Your little one may be starting to make an exit plan by shifting to the heads-down position, all while working on important preparations such as building body fat and brain matter.
        
        Your body is also in prep mode: You may feel some Braxton Hicks contractions as your uterine muscles practice for the big day.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 35</h2>
    <h3>35 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>If you're 35 weeks pregnant, you're in month 8 of your pregnancy. Only 1 month left to go! Still have questions? Here's some more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.

    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 35 weeks? </h3>
    <p>Your baby is standing tall this week at about 18 inches. But at about 5¼ pounds, he's continuing his steady weight gain: He'll pack on anywhere from 1 pound to several, including large amounts of baby fat, up 'til delivery day.

    </p>
    <h3>Fetal weight gain</h3>
    <p>Your baby's once skinny arms and legs are now quite plump…and irresistibly, squeezably soft.</p>
    <h3>Baby's skull remains soft</h3>
    <p>Something else that's developing at a mind-boggling pace these day: your baby's brainpower. Luckily, the part that surrounds that amazing brain — the skull — remains soft. And for good reason: A soft skull will allow your baby to squeeze more easily through the birth canal.

    </p>
    <h2>Your Body at Week 35</h2>
    <div class="picturesix">
        <img src="picturesix.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>Cheat sheet</h3>
    <p>Did you know that the measurement in centimeters from the top of your pubic bone to the top of your uterus is roughly equivalent to the number of weeks of pregnancy?

        So when you're 35 weeks pregnant, your practitioner will likely be measuring about 35 centimeters on the tape measure. It's an easy way to remember how far along you are — as if you'd ever lose track.
    </p>
    <h3>Frequent urination and urinary incontinence</h3>
    <p>Something else that'll remind you just how far along you are in your pregnancy: frequent urination. Yep, it's first trimester déjà vu all over again, but this time, instead of pregnancy hormones to blame, it's the position of your baby's head.

        Now that your baby is head-down in preparation for delivery, his noggin is pressing squarely on your bladder. The result? A need to pee all the time.
        
        As if that's not enough, you may also experience urgency — gotta go now! — or a lack of bladder control when you cough, sneeze or even laugh (though there's nothing funny about it).
        
        Whatever you do, don't cut back on fluids. Instead, empty your bladder as completely as possible by leaning forward — just be careful not to tip over — wear a panty liner if you need one and practice your Kegel exercises, which will strengthen the pelvic muscles and prevent or correct most cases of pregnancy-induced incontinence.
    </p>
    <h3>Finding a doula</h3>
    <p>What's a doula? The literal translation is "woman's servant." Now, if only you could find a chef, massage therapist and chauffeur…

        A doula can do double duty when you need it the most. First, there's the birth doula, a companion who's professionally trained to provide support — and a hand to hold — during labor. The other is a postpartum one (read more about them in week 42).
        
        A birth doula knows all about breathing and relaxation techniques for labor, as well as the best positions to alleviate the pain. Some laboring women actually find they need less pain medication — or none at all — when a doula is present, although a good birth doula will explore all pain relief options with you and help you choose what's right for your situation.
        
        But a doula's most important role may be the emotional comfort provided during a potentially frightening time, and that might be just what the doctor — or midwife — ordered.
        
        To find a doula, consult an agency, ask other moms for recommendations and consult our article on hiring a doula.

    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Research your pain options</h3>
    <p>These days, there are plenty of safe and effective medical options that can take some of the labor out of labor and delivery. It is possible to create a birth plan that ensures little or no pain while you remain awake during the entire process and are able to greet your newborn as he emerges.

        Make sure you know about all your labor pain relief options, including local anesthesia and breathing techniques. You may change your mind about the particulars as the time nears.
    </p>
    <h3>Stock up on nasal strips</h3>
    <p>The pregnancy hormones estrogen and progesterone can make the mucus membranes in your nose swell, making you feel all stuffy. (Little wonder this symptom is known as pregnancy rhinitis.)

        To combat congestion, buy a box of nasal strips that open up your nostrils. If your nose is extra dry, dab a little petroleum jelly in each nostril.
    </p>
    <h3>Prepare a birth plan</h3>
    <p>You've read all you can about pregnancy and childbirth, you've prepped for labor and delivery as well as anyone can and you're pretty sure you know exactly how you'd like the birth of your baby to go — from the first contraction to the last push.

        That’s where a birth plan comes in. Like the name suggests, a birth plan is a written plan that clearly states your preferences for before, during and after labor and delivery. After all, the best plan is to have a plan, so start thinking now about how you'd like the experience to go.
        
        Remember to be flexible, though. Even the best-laid plans can change at the last minute — so you’ll need to check your childbirth ideals at the hospital and let the doctors, nurses or midwives make the best decisions for you and your baby’s health.
    </p>
    <h3>Prevent pregnancy insomnia</h3>
    <p>Pregnancy insomnia affects an estimated 75 percent of moms-to-be — and it can hit especially hard in the third trimester (just when you need sleep the most!).

        What’s more, even if you are tired, your burgeoning belly — and active baby — can prevent you from getting comfortable again and falling back to sleep.
        
        Before you go to bed, try to wind down with a soothing bedtime routine: Do some light reading, take a warm bath and try meditation or relaxation exercises.
        
        If you can’t drift off after 20 to 30 minutes, get out of bed and find a small, boring task to do — like sorting baby onesies. Then try to nod off again.
    </p>
    <h3>Relieve heartburn</h3>
    <div class="picture17">
        <img src="picture17.png">
    </div>
    <p>Nearly half of all moms-to-be have heartburn during pregnancy — so if you’re feeling the burn, rest assured you’re in good company.

        Rule number one: Make sure to sit upright while eating and stay that way for a couple of hours after you eat if possible. Lying down, slouching, slumping and stooping will do you in. When you have to bend, do it with your knees instead of your waist — otherwise, you'll send all that acid for a repeat ride up your esophagus.
        
        While you're eating, do your body a favor and eat slowly. Chewing is the first step in the digestive process, but it's the one that's most often neglected when eating's done on the run. The more you chew, the less work your stomach has to do.
        
        Another chew that's good for you: sugarless gum, which will increase saliva and help neutralize acid in the esophagus. Just don't overdo it — too much can cause a laxative effect thanks to the sugar alcohols in it.
        
        Lastly, try to leave stress off the menu whenever possible (easier said than done, we know) — anxious eating compounds digestive distresses of all kinds, including heartburn.
    </p>
    <h3>Keep hitting the gym</h3>
    <div class="picture54">
        <img src="picture54.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>How's this for a payoff? Babies of pregnant exercisers tend to sleep through the night sooner, are less prone to colic and are better able to soothe themselves.

        Scientists attribute the positive link to babies being stimulated through changes in heart rate and oxygen levels, as well as the sounds and vibrations they experience in the womb during workouts. But who cares about the science? Pass the sneakers and lace 'em up!
    </p>
    <h3>Watch for sneaky sources of sugar</h3>
    <p>You think you’re being healthy by having a strawberry yogurt, but it turns out a lot of fruit-filled yogurts contain almost as much sugar as a small candy bar (though admittedly, some of it isn't added sugar, it's sugar from the fruit and milk).

        Look for yogurts with under 20 grams of sugar per serving on the label, and if possible, even less (as low as 10 to 12 grams).
