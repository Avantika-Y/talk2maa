    <p>
    This week, your baby is starting to look more like, well, a baby — your little one’s head is taking shape, while the cheeks, chin and 
    jaws are also beginning to form.
    n week 6 of pregnancy, you may be feeling well and truly pregnant too, thanks to symptoms like heartburn, nausea and frequent 
    urination.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 6</h2>
    <h3>6 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're 6 weeks pregnant, you're in month 2 of your pregnancy. Only 7 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some 
        more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 6 weeks?</h3>
    <p>
        When you're 6 weeks pregnant, your baby's crown-to-rump measurement (more on this below) is anywhere from a fifth to a quarter 
        of an inch and growing — making it the size of a nailhead or a sweet pea (your little sweet pea!).
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's head takes shape</h3>
    <p>
        You might be coping with full-blown pregnancy symptoms, but there's plenty of good news too. The folds of tissue in the prominent 
        bump on top — the head — are developing into your baby's jaw, cheeks and chin, which will eventually become one adorable face.
        And are those little indentations on both sides of the head the sweet dimples you always hoped your baby would inherit from your 
        mom's side of the family? No, they're ear canals in the making. Small dots on the face will form the eyes and button nose in 
        a few weeks.
        Also taking shape this week: your baby's kidneys, liver and lungs, along with his little heart.
    </p>
    <h3>Measuring your embryo</h3>
    <div class="picture21">

    </div>
    <p>
        During embryo and fetal development, practitioners measure babies as small as yours from precious little crown to cute little 
        rump. That's because as your baby grows, her legs will be bent, making it hard to get an accurate read on the full length 
        of the body.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Body at Week 6</h2>
    <div class="pictureone">
        <img src="pictureone.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>Frequent urination</h3>
    <p>
        Your body may not yet have changed on the outside, but you'll be reminded you're 6 weeks pregnant every time you feel queasy or 
        bloated or dive head-first into your sixth grapefruit of the day — funny, because you never craved grapefruit before.
        Another clue? You're in the bathroom more than you're out of it. Frequent urination is a symptom no pregnant woman enjoys, 
        especially when it breaks up the sleep you really need right now, but it's one of the most common symptoms of pregnancy, 
        especially early on.
        Why? For one thing, the pregnancy hormone hCG is causing an increase of blood flow to your pelvic area — good for increased 
        sexual pleasure, not so good when you're one hour into a two-hour movie at the theater.
        What's more, your kidneys are becoming more efficient at ridding your body of waste. Add to that the fact that your growing 
        uterus is beginning to push down on your bladder, leaving less storage space for urine, and you've got a perfect (pee) storm. 
        Luckily, this pressure is often relieved once the uterus rises into the abdominal cavity in the second trimester.
        Here's a quick tip: Lean forward when you pee to ensure that your bladder is completely emptied each time. Then, when you think 
        you’re done, pee again. This way, you might need fewer trips to the bathroom. But don't be tempted to cut back on liquids — your 
        body needs a steady supply of fluids.
    </p>
    <h3>Heartburn and indigestion</h3>
    <div class="picture22">
        <img src="picture22.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        Here’s the not-so-great news — the chances of getting through the next nine months heartburn-free are nearly zero. That’s 
        because the band of muscle at the top of the stomach that usually prevents digestive juices from backing up relaxes.
        But here's better news: You can minimize the symptoms if you avoid foods like citruses and tomatoes — and yes, that includes 
        pizza and pasta sauce — steer clear of greasy and spicy foods, don't rush through your meals and avoid clothes that constrict 
        your belly. It's also a good idea to finish dinner at least four hours before going to bed and keeping your head elevated on a 
        pillow while you sleep.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Don't skip all seafood</h3>
    <div class="picture23">
        <img src="picture23.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        For the pregnant set, not all fish is created equal. While you should avoid high-mercury fish like tilefish from the Gulf of 
        Mexico, shark, swordfish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, marlin and king mackerel, don’t steer clear of all good-for-you seafood.
        Fish is one of the best sources of DHA (a healthy omega-3 fatty acid), so try to eat two to three servings of well-cooked 
        shellfish, canned light tuna, salmon (wild-caught is best) or cod a week.
    </p>
    <h3>Look out for UTI symptoms</h3>
    <p>
        If it hurts to pee or if you gotta go but nothing comes, you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI). Talk to your doctor to 
        find out for sure.
        If you do have a UTI, you'll likely be prescribed a baby-safe antibiotic. You're at a higher risk of getting this kind of 
        infection after week 6 of pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>Go bland</h3>
    <p>
        Still suffering from morning sickness? Sadly, it isn't limited to the mornings at all — unless you count mornings in every time 
        zone.
        If you feel like screaming whenever you look at a saltine, don't panic. You have more options than you might think.
        Dry and bland are still the key here, but that describes more than a cracker. Dry cereal, pretzels, rice cakes, well-toasted 
        bread and bread sticks are all suitable to stash in your purse or keep on the bedside table.
    </p>
    <h3>Get your steps in</h3>
    <p>
        It's one thing to make the commitment to exercise — it's another thing to make time for it, particularly if you're often 
        feeling nauseous.
        The best strategy is to block out a specific time in your day for working out — rather than waiting until you find half an hour 
        to get around to it (hint: You never will).
    </p>
    <h3>Choose healthy treats</h3>
    <div class="picture24">
        <img src="picture24.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        For every sweet or salty junk food you're craving now, there's a healthier choice that, coupled with some willpower, can keep 
        your taste buds — and your baby — happy.
        Substitute soy chips or baked chips for the greasy varieties. Or munch your way through some air-popped popcorn (tossed with 
        some Parmesan for that salty kick you crave), rice cakes or pretzels.
        If your inner chocoholic is clamoring to come out, satisfy it with a cup of hot chocolate or a single-serving Fudgsicle instead 
        of that king-sized Snickers bar.
        Screaming for ice cream? Fall for frozen yogurt instead — and top yours with fresh berries to score nutritional brownie points.
    </p>
    <h3>Pamper yourself</h3>
    <div class="picture25">
        <img src="picture25.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        Relax — it's perfectly safe to paint your nails. Take advantage now, since pregnancy hormones can make them grow faster and 
        stronger than ever.
        As for acrylics, there's no proof that the chemicals are harmful to you or your fetus, but to be absolutely safe, you might want 
        to forgo those tips until your baby arrives.
        Non-toxic and water-based ingredients in polish might also be a good idea, as is a well-ventilated salon (this is true whether 
        you're pregnant or not).
        If your hormones didn't get the memo and you find that your nails have become weak or brittle, try a clear nail hardener and 
        reapply often (plus make sure you're getting enough calcium).
    </p>
    <h3>Prepare for your first prenatal visit</h3>
    <p>
        Sure, you already got the news from your home pregnancy test — but it doesn't hurt to hear it confirmed by a doctor, which is 
        one reason you're probably looking forward to your very first prenatal doctor's appointment. Expect this checkup to be
        exciting…and long.
        Ask your practitioner whether there are any COVID-19 rules you should know about and follow before coming in for your 
        appointment.
        Once you arrive, you'll have a thorough physical, including a pelvic exam, Pap smear and initial blood tests to determine your 
        blood type, Rh factor, whether you're iron-deficient and whether your baby is at risk for chromosomal abnormalities.
        You'll also be tested for sexually transmitted infections, immunity to rubella (German measles) and ethnic-specific genetic 
        diseases. And you'll need to pee into a cup so your urine can be tested for glucose, protein, red and white blood cells, and 
        bacteria.
        Be prepared to answer lots of questions — health histories can take a while — but more importantly, bring a list of some of your 
        own. Wondering whether you and Joe (aka your beloved extra-foamy mocha cappuccino) will have to part ways now that you're 
        expecting? Why your chest suddenly resembles a map of an interstate highway? If having sex can hurt your baby? Don't just sit 
        there — ask!
        Remember, no question is silly now. While you’re at it, talk to your doctor about whether you should get noninvasive prenatal 
        testing (NIPT) — a screening for chromosomal abnormalities recommended for some at-risk moms that’s given as early as week 10 of 
        pregnancy.
