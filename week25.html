    <h1>25 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby is as big as an eggplant.</h2>

    <p>Now that you're in week 25 of pregnancy, your uterus is about the size of a soccer ball and you may finally have that pronounced baby bump you've been imagining since the start.

        Meanwhile, your baby's nose and lungs are becoming more functional in preparation for life on the outside.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 25</h2>
    <h3>25 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>If you're 25 weeks pregnant, you're in month 6 of your pregnancy. Only 3 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.

    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 25 weeks?</h3>
    <p>Your baby is growing by leaps and bounds, reaching 13 inches — over a foot long! — in length and more than 1½ pounds in weight.

        That's taller than two juice boxes stacked one on top of the other and almost as heavy as four of them.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's lungs are gearing up to breathe</h3>
    <p>What else is going on this week? No matter what your baby's skin color will eventually be, it's turning pinker now — and not because he's getting overheated.

        In fact, the amniotic fluid is perfectly climate-controlled, keeping him at an always-comfortable temperature. Instead, the skin is changing color because small blood vessels, called capillaries, are forming under the skin and filling with blood.
        
        Later this week, blood vessels will also develop in your baby's lungs, bringing them one step closer to full maturity — and one step closer to taking that first breath of fresh air. But at 25 weeks pregnant, those lungs are still very much works-in-progress.
        
        Though they are already beginning to produce surfactant, a substance that will help them expand with oxygen after baby is born, the lungs are still too undeveloped to sufficiently send oxygen to the bloodstream and release carbon dioxide when she exhales.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby’s nose starts working</h3>
    <p>The lungs aren't the only system that's gearing up for air intake. Your baby's nostrils and nose are starting to work this week, too. This allows your little one to begin taking practice breaths.

        It was previously believed that the nostrils stay plugged up until around now in the pregnancy, but the latest research shows they open much earlier and stay that way through all three trimesters.
        
        Of course, since there's no air in there, your baby is really only "breathing" amniotic fluid, but it's the practice that counts, right?
        
        Baby could also be able to smell various scents in utero by this week, too. If not, that sense will kick in by the third trimester.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Body at Week 25</h2>

    <h3>Having a ball?</h3>
    <p>At 25 weeks pregnant, your ever-growing uterus has now reached the size of a soccer ball. Look at that — you're already a soccer mom and you didn't even have to buy the minivan.

        But while you're probably enjoying your cute soccer ball tummy up in front, and getting to know your growing little midfielder through all those practice kicks, chances are you're not enjoying what's going on in your backside.
    </p>
    <h3>Hemorrhoids</h3>
    <p>More than half of all pregnant women experience swollen, itchy veins in the rectum due to that bigger uterus pressing down as well as to increased blood flow to the area. And while they're not dangerous to your body, hemorrhoids — a form of varicose veins — can be downright painful and even cause rectal bleeding. 

        Constipation can aggravate them, so your best bet at prevention is to increase your fluid and fiber intake and to eat plenty of fiber-rich foods, like fruits, veggies and whole grains. Doing pelvic-floor exercises (Kegels) and trying not to strain when you poop can help too.
        
        In the meantime, try witch hazel pads, sitz baths or ice packs to soothe your sore bottom — and keep in mind that they should go away after delivery — though you're probably getting tired of hearing that!
    </p>
    <h3>Dental health    </h3>
    <div class="picture16">
        <img src="picture16.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Want to up your chances of keeping your baby safely inside you until term? Whip out the dental floss and make sure you're brushing your teeth at least twice a day, since research links good dental health and oral hygiene with longer pregnancies.

        Sounds kind of zany, but brushing your teeth at least twice a day, flossing regularly and visiting the dentist every six months can reduce the risk of gingivitis — a common condition in which your gums become inflamed, red and even begin to bleed.
        
        If you don't take proper care of your teeth, the result can be periodontitis, which has been linked to premature birth and even an increased risk of preeclampsia. 
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Play the baby name game</h3>
    <p>You’ve been playing Name That Baby for a while now. Ask yourself these questions before committing to a baby name: What do the initials spell? Are there awkward rhymes? What are any likely nicknames?

        Consider the cadence, and be careful about combinations that could turn your child's name into a joke. How long will it take for Savannah Anna to become Savannah Anna Banana?
    </p>
    <h3>Slather on moisturizer</h3>
    <p>Your uterus is now the size of a soccer ball — and all that stretching may be causing your tummy to itch.

        Skin irritation is a common problem that tends to appear during the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy, when you’re really starting to show. Unfortunately, it only seems to get more pronounced as time passes and your belly continues to grow. Slather on moisturizer or calamine lotion if needed.
    </p>
    <h3>Organize your kitchen</h3>
    <p>If a 30-minute meal takes 20 minutes more than you've got, you need a speedy kitchen at your service. Make sure you have the right gear on hand, and use it.

        Your microwave can do more than warm a cup of tea or reheat leftovers: It can even be used to cook a whole dinner!
        
        On the flip side, a slow cooker can be your best time-saver. Don't let the name fool you: Toss in whatever you have in the house, including meat, beans, veggies and broth; turn it on in the morning; and come home at the end of the day to a delicious hot meal — plus plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.
        
        Cleanup is a breeze too. Just rinse the pot and run it through the dishwasher, but check your directions first.
        
        Rely on your blender to produce smoothies in seconds, your food processor to chop everything before you count to five and a toaster oven to warm or melt anything in less time than it takes to preheat your oven.
    </p>
    <h3>Feeling down? Talk to your doctor</h3>
    <p>Depression during pregnancy and postpartum depression (PPD) are surprisingly common. Some symptoms include crying, irritability, a lack of appetite and poor sleep, among others.

        One study suggests that downplaying positive emotions — aka “I don't deserve to be happy” — might increase your risk for the condition. Sound familiar? Talk to your doctor as soon as you can about getting help.
    </p>
    <h3>Snack on healthy sweets</h3>
    <div class="picture24">
        <img src="picture24.png">
    </div>
    <p>Need some sweet snack ideas? When you've been hit by the midday slump, nosh on carrot or oat bran muffins (they can replace donuts and coffee cake) along with a wedge of cheese or a container of yogurt.

        Or pick yourself up with apple wedges and peanut butter, all-fruit jam spread on a whole wheat English muffin, cottage cheese with strawberries, tangerines and cinnamon, yogurt topped with walnuts and dried fruit, or a smoothie.
    </p>
    <h3>Take note of eye symptoms</h3>
    <p>Your eyes are yet another seemingly random part of the body affected by those kooky hormones. During this time, your vision might be less sharp — Is that you, Honey? — and your contact lenses might be less comfortable to wear.

        Another twist in the eye story: Even though you're retaining fluid, ironically, your eyes may be drier than ever.
        
        But don't worry — eye symptoms, like skin symptoms, will disappear after delivery. Just be sure to let your practitioner know what's going on, so your doc can "keep an eye on things."
    </p>
    <h3>
        Simplify your grocery list
    </h3>
    <p>You don't have to buy processed food if you want to stock up on healthy staples.

        When it comes to produce, snacks and dairy products, think small, convenient and ready-to-nibble — look for single-serve packs of yogurt, 8-ounce tubs of cottage cheese, individually wrapped string cheese, pre-cut fresh fruit salads, mini packs of baby carrots and small boxes or bags of raisins, nuts, dried fruit and trail mix.
        
        And don't forget to load up on small cans of tomato or vegetable juice. That way, no matter how busy you are, you can grab and go with a nutritious bite (and sip) in hand.
        
        Other shortcuts you should definitely take: using frozen vegetables and fruits, ready-washed bags of salad, and fast-cooking cuts of meat and poultry (for stir-fry or fajitas).
