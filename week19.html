    <h1>19 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby is as big as a mango.</h2>

    <p>With 19 weeks down, you're entering pregnancy month 5.

        Get ready for some exciting pregnancy milestones, like feeling baby's first kicks if you haven't already and the 20-week ultrasound, or anatomy scan, where you'll get to meet your baby up close.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 19</h2>
    <h3>19 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>If you're 19 weeks pregnant, you're in month 5 of your pregnancy. Only 4 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.

    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 19 weeks?    </h3>
    <p>Six inches long this week and just over a half pound in weight, your baby has gone through a bit of a growth spurt. 

    </p>
    <h3>Vernix develops    </h3>
    <p>Your little one may have a cheesy varnish this week.

        Say what? You read that right — a protective substance called vernix caseosa (vernix is the Latin word for "varnish"; caseosa means "cheese") now covers your fetus' skin. It's greasy, white and made up of that downy hair known as lanugo, oil from your baby's glands and dead skin cells.
        
        This waxy "cheese" may not sound too appealing, but it's there for good reason: Vernix protects your baby's sensitive skin from the surrounding amniotic fluid. Without it, he'd look very wrinkled at birth — sort of what you'd look like if you soaked in a bath for nine months.
        
        The vernix sheds as delivery approaches, though some babies — especially those born early — will still be covered with it at birth, so you might get a look at your baby's first anti-wrinkle cream.

    <h3>Leg Cramps</h3>
    <p>There's nothing like getting into bed at the end of a long, exhausting day — especially when you're pregnant. Aching for a good night's sleep — literally, if your back's been acting up again — you throw back the covers and prepare to happily drift into dreamland.

        But if you're like many expecting moms, something may be keeping you awake tonight — besides what color to paint the nursery: leg cramps.
        
        These painful spasms that radiate up and down your calves are very common during the second and third trimester. While these cramps can occur during the day, you'll notice them — oh, baby, will you notice them! — more at night.
        
        No one knows for sure what causes them, though there are plausible theories aplenty. It could be that your leg muscles are just fatigued from carrying around all the extra weight of pregnancy. Or that the vessels that carry blood to and from your legs are compressed by your growing uterus at 19 weeks pregnant. 
        
        There's also speculation that it may be somehow related to diet or not being fully hydrated, though this hunch hasn't been substantiated by studies.
        
        Whatever the cause, you'll need a quick fix when a leg cramp does strike — especially when it's standing (or lying) between you and a good night's sleep. So here's one for you: Straighten your leg and gently flex your ankle and toes back toward your shins.
    </p>
    <h3>Feeling baby's kicks</h3>
    <div class="picture59">
        <img src="picture59.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Your sister said baby kicked by this point in pregnancy — and so did your best friend — but so far, you haven't felt a thing. Except those gas bubbles this morning … those were gas, weren't they?

        Maybe, maybe not. Those first tiny kicks can be felt many different ways — generally starting between week 18 and week 22, though it can be a week or two later if this is your first pregnancy.
        
        Sometimes you might feel like something is swimming inside you (which it is!), while other times those first fetal movements may feel more like bufferflies in your tummy.
        
        Once your baby grows bigger, you'll be able to easily tell what those little kicks feel like, so there won't be any mistaking them for something else. Learn more about fetal movement during pregnancy.

    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Ask about yeast infections</h3>
    <p>With so much going on down there already, the last thing you need is an itchy yeast infection when you're pregnant. Unfortunately, you're especially likely to get them during pregnancy, thanks in part to higher estrogen levels that cause an overgrowth of yeast.

        Another downside: Yeast infections are harder to control during this time. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment.
    </p>
    <h3>Consider support hose</h3>
    <p>If you're struggling with edema, or swelling, you might find it useful to invest in a pair of support hose. Full pantyhose (with extra tummy room) or knee- or thigh-highs that aren't tight on top are good choices. Put them on in the morning before the daily swelling starts so they can do their job more effectively.

        Also helpful for edema, as well as for leg and back pain during pregnancy: a comfortable pair of shoes.
    </p>
    <h3>Rethink 3D ultrasounds</h3>
    <div class="picture60">
        <img src="picture60.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>It's tempting to book an appointment for a 3D or 4D sonogram at your local prenatal portrait center, especially if you've seen those stunning in-utero baby photos and videos online.

        But even though there is no reliable scientific evidence showing that ultrasounds are harmful to a developing fetus, the potential risks of the technology are unclear. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says that ultrasounds should only be performed by qualified medical professionals — and for medical reasons. So steer clear of the elective ones for now, no matter how tempting they look.
    </p>
    <h3>Increase your fiber intake — gradually</h3>
    <div class="picture34">
        <img src="picture34.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Eating a healthy amount of fiber can help you go when you have to go. The downside: Adding too much fiber to your diet too quickly can trigger bloating, cramping and gas (and let's face it, you probably already have enough of that).

        If you're trying to fit in more fiber than ever, increase your intake slowly and gently — for example, a sprinkle of chia seeds in your breakfast cereal or a snack of trail mix in the afternoon — so that your body has time to adjust to its new normal.
    </p>
    <h3>Plump up your pillows</h3>
    <p>You may not have snored in the past, but now that you're pregnant, you can't seem to get a good night's sleep.

        Usually, snoring during pregnancy is more annoying than serious (it's usually caused by an uptick in nasal congestion, which can start around week 16), but occasionally, it can be caused by a chronic condition called obstructive sleep apnea. Ask your health care provider about it and get tips on what to do for relief.
        
    </p>
    <h3>Make a sandwich    </h3>
    <p>Wraps, paninis, double-deckers — no matter what type of sandwich you crave, make it a healthy one, with lean protein, fiber and whole grains. Fill it to bursting with greens so you optimize your lunch.

        Just forgo any sprouts as they can harbor bacteria, and skip traditional lunch meats, which contain nitrates and nitrites, for more creative solutions.
        
    </p>
    <h3>Keep things moving</h3>
    <p>Eight to 10 full glasses of fluids — water, vegetable or fruit juice, broth — each day will help keep solids moving through your digestive tract at an impressive rate and keep your stool soft and easier to pass.

        Prune juice is tops in the category since it's a mild laxative. Try to drink some when you're really clogged, and if you have trouble taking it straight, blend it with other fruits and juices into a smoothie.
        
        Another time-honored way to get things moving: Turn to warm liquids including that health-spa staple, hot water and lemon. They'll help stimulate peristalsis, those intestinal contractions that help you go.
