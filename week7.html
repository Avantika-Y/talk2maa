    <h1>7 Weeks Pregnant</h1>
    <h2>Your baby is as big as a blueberry.</h2>
    <div class="picture26">

    </div>
    <p>
        Here’s a fun fact: At 7 weeks pregnant, your embryo is now 10,000 times bigger than it was when it arrived in your uterus! Your 
        baby is growing rapidly and generating new brain cells at a rate of 100 per minute.
        As you head into the second half of your first trimester, it's common to experience symptoms like morning sickness, tender 
        breasts and food aversions.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Baby at Week 7</h2>
    <h3>7 weeks pregnant is how many months?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're 7 weeks pregnant, you're in month 2 of your pregnancy. Only 7 months left to go! Still have questions? Here's some 
        more information on how weeks, months and trimesters are broken down in pregnancy.
    </p>
    <h3>How big is my baby at 7 weeks?</h3>
    <p>
        Your baby's approximately a quarter of an inch in length now — about the size of a blueberry. Sounds pretty tiny still? 
        Consider this for a little perspective: Your baby is 10,000 times bigger now than she was at conception a month ago.
    </p>
    <h3>New brain cells form rapidly</h3>
    <p>
        At 7 weeks pregnant, most of that growth is concentrated in the head (the better to store all those smarts) as new brain cells 
        are generated at the rate of 100 per minute. How's that for a budding genius?
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's arms and legs start developing</h3>
    <p>
        And talking about buds, your baby is going out on a limb this week. Her arm and leg buds begin to sprout and grow longer and 
        stronger, dividing into hand, arm and shoulder segments and leg, knee and foot segments — though the limb buds look more like 
        paddles than hands or feet at this early stage.
    </p>
    <h3>Baby's got kidneys</h3>
    <p>
        Also forming this week are your baby's mouth and tongue. The kidneys are in place now, too, and are poised to begin their 
        important work of waste management. Soon, your baby will start producing urine. Lucky for you, there's no need for diapers yet. 
    </p>
    <h2>Your Body at Week 7</h2>
    <div class="pictureone">
        <img src="pictureone.jpg">
    </div>
    <h3>Know the signs</h3>
    <p>
        Even if you're not telling anyone you're pregnant yet, your baby's certainly telling you. Not in so many words, but in so many 
        pregnancy symptoms. Like that nagging pregnancy nausea that follows you around day and night or all that excess saliva pooling 
        in your mouth (am I drooling?).
        Then there's that other early pregnancy sign you certainly can't miss, especially when you struggle to button your blouse over 
        your ever-growing breasts (are these really mine?).
    </p>
    <h3>Your swollen breasts</h3>
    <p>
        Though your baby is the size of a blueberry, your breasts probably look more like melons. Some women have grown a full cup size 
        at 7 weeks pregnant — which might be welcome news if those boobs weren't so uncomfortably tender, tingly and achy. The culprit? 
        Those naughty-but-necessary pregnancy hormones again, estrogen and progesterone.
        Fat is also building up in your breasts and blood flow to the area is increasing. Your nipples may be sticking out a little more 
        than usual, but they're so sensitive and tender that they may hurt to the touch.
        The areola, the dark area around the nipple, has already gotten darker and larger — and will continue to grow and deepen in 
        color over the months to come.
        You'll also notice little goose-bump-like spots on the areola. These bumps, called Montgomery's tubercles, are sebaceous glands 
        that supply lubrication to the areola.
        And in case you're wondering why all these changes are taking place, here's your answer: They're all essential to the important 
        task of breastfeeding your newborn in about 33 weeks!
    </p>
    <h3>Coping with food aversions</h3>
    <p>
        If one look at a chicken breast is sending you flying out the door these days — or if the smell of Swiss cheese is making your 
        digestive tract yodel with anguish — you're in good company. Pregnancy food aversions are not only very common, they are also 
        quite confusing, especially when your once-favorite food suddenly leaves you cold — and feeling nauseous.
        The best advice: Cater to your new tastes, by all means. Keep your meals bland and boring, find substitutes for foods you have 
        an aversion to — think quinoa for protein if you can't stand the sight or smell of meat — and rejoice if your aversions are to 
        foods that you're supposed to be avoiding anyway.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips for You This Week</h2>
    <h3>Know how much you've gained or lost</h3>
    <div class="picture27">
        <img src="picture27.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        You can't see a baby bump yet, but you may have gained a few pounds. That’s completely fine. Women with a normal BMI of 18.5 to 
        24.9 will likely gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, while women with higher or lower BMIs have a slightly different 
        pregnancy weight range to keep in mind.
        During your first trimester, your baby is still tiny, which means you may not gain more than a total of two to four pounds.
        However, if you're suffering from morning sickness, you might not gain an ounce — or might even lose a little. That's okay too, 
        as long as your appetite picks up and you make up for those pounds in the second trimester.
    </p>
    <h3>Cramping is usually normal</h3>
    <p>
        If you experience abdominal cramps while you’re expecting, it’s not necessarily cause for concern. Cramping is normal during the 
        first trimester, but if it occurs with shoulder or neck pain or if it’s accompanied by contractions, dizziness or discharge, call 
        the doctor. Also call if your abdominal pain feels like more than just cramps and is more severe.
    </p>
    <h3>Fruit is your friend</h3>
    <div class="picture28">
        <img src="picture28.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        Not only does nature's sweetest bounty contain essential nutrients that are good for you and your baby, but fruit also plays a 
        starring role in keeping you regular.
        A good nutritional rule of thumb: When you're looking to "eat a rainbow" of fruit colors, look to the inside of the fruit as 
        much as (if not more than) the outside.
        For example, a cantaloupe might have a lighter-colored skin on the outside, but the deep orange flesh of the melon inside is 
        packed with vitamins A and C, plus some important minerals.
    </p>
    <h3>Know your workout no-no's</h3>
    <p>
        Here's a quick list of some things to avoid during your pregnancy workouts:
          Don't exercise on your back after the first trimester.
          Try not to hold your breath while you work out.
          Steer clear of jerky or twisting motions, which could add insult to your already stressed-out joints.
          Be careful about moves that challenge your sense of balance or risk any sort of trauma to your abdomen.
        You'll soon have less oxygen available for exercise, so stop when you get tired and avoid getting overheated. Now isn't the 
        time to do bikram or "hot" yoga.
    </p>
    <h3>Safely manage skin problems</h3>
    <p>
        Pregnancy can cause some pretty wacky complexion complexities (thank you, hormones!) — from excessive oiliness to excessive 
        dryness (or both at the same time), from acne to blotchiness, and most strangely, melasma, a patchy skin discoloration.
        If pimples are the problem, wash your face two to three times a day with a thorough but gentle cleanser — harsh ones will only 
        leave skin more open to irritation.
        Exfoliate very gently too, around once a week, and finish off with an oil-free moisturizer. Overly stripped skin is more prone 
        to breakouts.
    </p>
    <h3>Indulge healthy cravings</h3>
    <p>
        What should you do when cravings strike? That depends. Give in, if you're lucky enough to be craving fruits or vegetables. Try to 
        vary things a bit if you can, but don't worry if your taste buds won't take the bait.
        But try to resist your cravings if they're sending you to a bowl of sugar-frosted cereal or a bag of kettle-cooked potato chips. 
        Eat Cheerios topped with fresh fruit and a drizzle of honey, or dive into a bag of soy crisps, which are packed with protein.
        If your cravings are for something you shouldn't have now that you're expecting — like unpasteurized soft cheese or sashimi — 
        sub something that comes as close as possible to the object of your affections, like pasteurized feta and teriyaki salmon.
        If you find yourself craving substances that aren't food, like clay, ashes or laundry starch, contact your practitioner. Such 
        cravings could indicate a condition called pica, which is triggered by a nutritional deficiency.
    </p>
    <h3>Cater to your aversions</h3>
    <p>
        If you can't stomach the thought of eating a chicken breast, you're not alone. Pregnancy aversions are very common.
        Just do what works. Keep your choices bland and boring, find substitutes for foods you can no longer stomach — think fruit if
        you can't stand the sight of veggies — and rejoice if your aversions are to foods that you're supposed to be avoiding anyway 
        (sushi aversion, anyone?).
